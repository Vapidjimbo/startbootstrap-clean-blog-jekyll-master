<h2 class="section-heading">About Jim</h2>

<p>I learned how to start a Jekyll blog site.  It's wasn't too bad since we used a layout to start with.  Using the npm to install Ruby was difficult only becasue I downloaded the wrong version at first.  And the incremntal command wasn't working all the time.  Being able to use layout pages and changing the page peoperties at the top of each page is super easy and quick.  Honestly, I like it about the same as Harp.  I would have to use both more though.  I would use Jekyll for future clients that want a quick and easy blog.  I would even use this over WordPress.</p>
