<p>I like cats. I've probably owned over 1000 in my life.  I breed them for a living and currently have three litters ready to sell. It takes a lot to run this joint.  From getting the cats to do the dirty to making sure they have a safe birth. And it's always sad to see them go off to their new homes. </p>
